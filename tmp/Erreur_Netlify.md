Diagnosis: The build failure seems to be due to issues with the node_modules directory, particularly with the browserslist package.

Solution:

    Remove the node_modules directory from the repo and add it to the .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to the repository. This will ensure that the dependencies are installed during the build process on Netlify.
    Make sure all necessary packages are listed in the package.json file and that the correct versions are specified.
    If the build still fails due to browserslist or any other package, verify that the package is included in the package.json or was committed to the repo. If necessary, add the package to the build configuration's external dependencies.
